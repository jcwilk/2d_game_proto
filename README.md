# 2D game prototype boilerplate

This repository is a **starting point for small 2D game experiments** where you want a clear place for code, specs, and task tracking, and you plan to use **AI-generated 2D assets** (sprites, tiles, UI) alongside hand-written game logic.

## Intent

- **Prototype-first:** favor a small, understandable layout over a full engine stack until you need it.
- **Assets:** treat generated art as replaceable: keep filenames and sizes stable in code, iterate in your image editor or generator without rewriting gameplay every time.
- **Collaboration with agents:** Cursor skills under **`.cursor/skills/`** and ticket workflows (**`./tk`**, **`.tickets/`**) are set up so planning, implementation, and review can stay structured as the project grows.

## Docs

- **`AGENTS.md`** — how **`wedow/ticket`** fits in, using **`./tk`**, and repo norms for agents.
- **`CONVENTIONS.md`** — coding conventions for this stack (e.g. TypeScript / Deno expectations).

## Tickets

From the repo root:

```bash
./tk help
```

Create `.env` from `.env.example` if you use tools that need API keys or path overrides.
